## Tech Debt Summary

### Minor Items (Non-blocking)

1. **SIZE-05/DOC-03: API Surface Reduction Target**
   - Target: 50-100 lines of public exports reduced
   - Actual: 16 lines reduced
   - Gap: 34-84 lines
   - Note: Remaining opportunities are in internal modules (pool, shutdown) which are not part of public API

2. **Clippy dead_code Warnings (5)**
   - Location: src/shutdown.rs, src/pool/mod.rs
   - Severity: Low (internal modules, not public API)
   - Impact: Cosmetic only

---

## Deliverables

| Deliverable | Evidence |
|-------------|----------|
| Test helpers (tests/helpers.rs) | 194 lines, 8 functions |
| Code organization | 17 files all under 600 lines |
| commands.rs reduced | 1850 → 47 lines |
| main.rs reduced | 809 → 16 lines |
| Zero cargo doc warnings | Confirmed |
| Codebase size | 9,568 lines (target: 10,800-11,500) |
| Test coverage maintained | 98 lib tests pass |

---

## Conclusion

**Status: tech_debt**

The v1.3 milestone is functionally complete. All core requirements are satisfied. The minor technical debt items (16 vs 50-100 lines API reduction, 5 clippy warnings in internal modules) are cosmetic and do not affect functionality, public API, or user experience.

The codebase is now:
- ✅ Smaller: 9,568 lines (23% reduction from 12,408)
- ✅ Better organized: All files under 600 lines
- ✅ Well-documented: Zero doc warnings, comprehensive module docs
- ✅ Quality: Zero cargo doc warnings, consistent error handling
