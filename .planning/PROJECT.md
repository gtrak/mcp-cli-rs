# MCP CLI Rust Rewrite

## What This Is

A Rust rewrite of the mcp-cli tool for interacting with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Provides a lightweight, single-binary CLI that developers and AI agents can use to discover, inspect, and execute tools from stdio and HTTP-based MCP servers.

## Core Value

Reliable cross-platform MCP server interaction without dependencies. Developers and AI agents can discover available tools, inspect schemas, and execute operations through a simple CLI that works consistently on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Requirements

### Validated

<details>

<summary>v1.2: Ergonomic CLI Output (18/18 requirements) — Shipped 2026-02-12</summary>

- ✅ Tool listing shows parameter overview (names, types, required/optional status) in help-style format
- ✅ Progressive detail levels via flags: default (summary) → `-d` (with descriptions) → `-v` (verbose with full schema)
- ✅ Default `list` command shows tool count and brief descriptions per server
- ✅ Multi-server listings have clear visual hierarchy (server headers, grouped tools)
- ✅ Consistent formatting across all commands (list, info, grep, call)
- ✅ Parameter display uses standard CLI conventions (e.g., `name <type>` for required, `name [type]` for optional)
- ✅ Tool descriptions are prominently displayed (not truncated in default view)
- ✅ Usage hints shown in tool listings (e.g., "Use `mcp info server tool` for full schema")
- ✅ Server status clearly indicated (connected, failed, disabled tools present)
- ✅ Tool search (grep) results show context (server name + tool description)
- ✅ Empty states have helpful messages (no servers configured, no tools found)
- ✅ Error messages maintain consistent format with context and suggestions
- ✅ Warnings are visually distinct but not overwhelming
- ✅ Partial failures (some servers down) show which succeeded and which failed
- ✅ JSON output mode (`--json` flag) for programmatic use and scripting
- ✅ JSON output includes complete tool metadata (name, description, parameters, schema)
- ✅ Plain text mode (`--no-color` or when piped) works correctly for all commands
- ✅ Machine-readable output follows consistent schema across all commands

### Active

**v1.3: Tech Debt Cleanup & Code Quality** (In Progress)

- [ ] Test setup helpers module reduces duplication across 8+ test files
- [ ] commands.rs refactored from 1850 lines into focused modules
- [ ] Documentation warnings fixed (cargo doc clean)
- [ ] Public API surface audited and reduced where appropriate
- [ ] main.rs cleanup with extracted daemon lifecycle functions
- [ ] Codebase size reduced by ~10-15% with equivalent functionality

### Out of Scope

- Public distribution/crates.io publishing — local compilation only
- MCP server implementation — this tool is a client only
- SSE and Streamable HTTP transports — deferred to post-MVP
- Tool aliasing/shortcuts — config complexity without clear benefit
- Multi-server transactions — MCP doesn't support transactions
- Tool output caching — Cache invalidation complexity; tools can implement their own caching if needed
- Environment variable substitution within config (${VAR}) — Using env vars to override layered config instead (simpler pattern)

## Current State: v1.3 Tech Debt Cleanup

**Status:** In cleanup phase 🧹

**Codebase Before Cleanup:**
- **12,408** lines of Rust code
- **9** documentation warnings (cargo doc)
- **1850** lines in single commands.rs file
- **8+** test files with repeated setup patterns

**Milestones Shipped:**
- **v1.0:** Core implementation with daemon connection pooling (Phases 1-5, 42 requirements)
- **v1.2:** Ergonomic CLI output with JSON mode and visual hierarchy (Phases 6-11, 18 requirements)

**Key Features Delivered:**
- Full MCP protocol support (stdio + HTTP transports)
- Configuration parsing (TOML, environment variables)
- Tool discovery with glob pattern search
- Tool execution with JSON validation and retry logic
- Connection daemon with unified single-binary architecture
- Tool filtering (allowedTools/disabledTools with glob patterns)
- Ergonomic output with progressive detail levels and visual hierarchy
- Machine-readable JSON output for scripting and automation
- Comprehensive cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Colored terminal output with NO_COLOR support
- Graceful signal handling and resource cleanup

**Known Issues:**
- **XP-04:** Cross-platform daemon requires runtime verification on Linux/macOS (infrastructure ready, tests available)

**Validation Status:**
- Windows tests executed successfully (XP-01, XP-02, XP-04 partial)
- Code quality: Zero compilation errors, zero clippy warnings
- All 60 requirements satisfied (42 v1 + 18 v1.2)

## Context

Original mcp-cli implementation exists at `../mcp-cli` and is Bun-based with the official MCP SDK. Reimplementation motivated by Windows process spawning issues and desire to remove Bun dependency for a standalone Rust binary.

The tool will be wrapped in a skill for LLM use, so error messages and output should be both human-readable and machine-parsable. Compatible with standard mcp_servers.json configuration format used by Claude Desktop, Gemini, and VS Code.

---

## Constraints

- **Tech Stack**: Rust — chosen for cross-platform binaries, no runtime dependencies, and reliable process spawning
- **MCP Client**: Rust MCP SDK used (implemented from scratch due to lack of stable Rust SDK)
- **Compatibility**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS without platform-specific bugs
- **Config**: Compatible with standard mcp_servers.json format and environment variable substitution
- **Daemons**: Uses Unix sockets (*nix) and named pipes (Windows) for connection caching
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with unit and integration tests
- **Distribution**: Single binary, local compilation only (no public package distribution)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Rust language | Fix Windows process spawning, remove Bun dependency, single binary | ✅ Verified - 60/60 requirements met across v1 and v1.2 |
| Daemon architecture | Maintain performance benefit of connection caching | ✅ Verified - 50%+ performance improvement |
| Unified daemon | Single binary with 3 operational modes (standalone, auto-spawn, require-daemon) | ✅ Simplified deployment and usage |
| Progressive detail levels | Summary → WithDescriptions → Verbose via -d/-v flags | ✅ Improves usability without overwhelming users |
| Visual hierarchy with status icons | Server state immediately obvious without reading text | ✅ Better user experience |
| JSON mode with consistent schema | Programmatic access for scripting and automation | ✅ Machine-parsable output for LLMs |
| reject_remote_clients for Windows | Stronger security than security_qos_flags requirement | ✅ Exceeds XP-02 requirement |
| Daemon filtering at CLI layer | IPC is internal implementation detail | ✅ Good design - CLI enforces filtering, daemon focuses on caching |

## Current Milestone: v1.3 Tech Debt Cleanup

**Goal:** Reduce codebase size, eliminate duplication, improve maintainability

**Target:**
- Eliminate 200-300 lines of test duplication via helpers module
- Refactor 1850-line commands.rs into 3-4 focused files
- Fix 9 documentation warnings
- Audit and reduce public API surface
- Extract daemon lifecycle from main.rs
- Overall codebase reduction: target 10-15% with equivalent functionality
