# Plan 05-03: Update Audit and Complete Milestone

**Status:** 📋 Ready to start
**Wave:** 1 of 1
**Priority:** High

**Goal:** Update v1 milestone audit to reflect all gaps resolved, create final milestone summary, and enable clean v1 milestone completion.

**Must Haves:**
1. **Milestone Audit Update**
   - Update v1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md status from "gaps_found" to "passed"
   - Update requirements score from 17/42 to 42/42 (100%)
   - Update phases score from 3/4 to 4/4 (100%)
   - Update integration audit status from "blocked" to "passed"
   - Update E2E flows status from "blocked" to "passed"

2. **Evidence Compilation**
   - Compile evidence from all 4 phase verifications
   - Document gap closure activities and outcomes
   - Create summary of all requirements now satisfied
   - Document any remaining non-critical tech debt

3. **Final Milestone Summary**
   - Create comprehensive summary of v1 milestone achievements
   - Document total requirements satisfied (42/42)
   - List key accomplishments across all phases
   - Note any deviations or compromises made

**Should Haves:**
1. **Requirements Traceability Update**
   - Update REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table status for all Phase 1 requirements
   - Change Phase 1 requirements from "Pending" to "Complete"
   - Add notes on any requirements that changed during implementation
   - Validate total coverage remains at 100%

2. **Tech Debt Summary**
   - Consolidate tech debt from all phase verifications
   - Categorize by severity (blocking vs non-blocking)
   - Document any performance concerns or future improvements
   - Create plan for addressing remaining tech debt

**Nice to Haves:**
1. **Lessons Learned**
   - Document key insights from each phase
   - Note any architectural decisions that paid off
   - Identify process improvements for future milestones
   - Create recommendations for v2 milestone planning

2. **Performance Summary**
   - Document performance improvements achieved
   - Compare against original objectives
   - Note any benchmarking results
   - Identify areas for further optimization

**Avoid These Pitfalls:**
1. **Incomplete evidence** - Ensure audit updates are backed by verification evidence
2. **Overly optimistic status** - Be honest about any remaining issues or compromises
3. **Missing traceability** - Ensure all requirements are properly traced to completion
4. **Tech debt dismissal** - Properly document and categorize remaining technical debt

**Dependencies:**
- Plan 05-01 completed (01-VERIFICATION.md created)
- Plan 05-02 completed (integration audit passed)
- All phase verifications available (01, 02, 03, 04-VERIFICATION.md)
- Current v1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md showing gaps

**Time Estimate:** 1 hour
**Complexity:** Low - primarily documentation updates and compilation

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] v1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md updated to "passed" status
- [ ] All requirements marked complete (42/42)
- [ ] All phases marked verified (4/4)
- [ ] Integration audit marked "passed"
- [ ] E2E flows marked "passed"
- [ ] REQUIREMENTS.md updated with Phase 1 completion
- [ ] Tech debt properly documented and categorized
- [ ] Final milestone summary created

**What Success Looks Like:**
Clean audit status showing v1 milestone fully verified and ready for completion, with all gaps documented and resolved, enabling confident milestone archival and tagging.

**Audit Update Checklist:**

1. **Status Updates:**
   - [ ] `status: gaps_found` → `status: passed`
   - [ ] `requirements: 17/25` → `requirements: 42/42` 
   - [ ] `phases: 3/4` → `phases: 4/4`
   - [ ] `integration: blocked` → `integration: passed`
   - [ ] `flows: blocked` → `flows: passed`

2. **Evidence Updates:**
   - [ ] Add Phase 1 verification evidence table
   - [ ] Update "Phase 1: Critical Blocker" section to "Phase 1: Resolved"
   - [ ] Update "Integration Audit Status" to "Passed"
   - [ ] Update "End-to-End Flow Verification Status" to "Passed"
   - [ ] Update "Recommendations" to reflect completion readiness

3. **Documentation Updates:**
   - [ ] Update conclusion to reflect milestone completion
   - [ ] Document gap closure activities
   - [ ] Create final recommendations summary
   - [ ] Update next steps to milestone completion

**Related Files:**
- `.planning/v1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` (primary target for updates)
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` (traceability table updates)
- Phase verification files (01, 02, 03, 04-VERIFICATION.md)
- Integration audit report from plan 05-02
